# Demo Research Cycle

You are running one experiment cycle of the autoresearch-inspired demo quality loop.

## Setup

1. Read `program-demo.md` to understand:
   - The current **lane** (which files you may edit)
   - The current **hypothesis** (what to fix)
   - The **accept/reject rule**
   - **Observations from previous runs** (what went wrong)
   - **Experiment history** (previous scores)

2. Read `AGENTS.md` for architecture context.

## Phase 1: Understand the problem

1. Read the files listed in the lane boundaries for the current lane.
2. If previous run artifacts exist in `runs/`, read the most recent `summary.json` to understand the baseline.
3. Form a specific, testable fix plan based on the hypothesis in `program-demo.md`.

## Phase 2: Apply the fix

1. Make the smallest change that tests the hypothesis.
2. Stay strictly within the lane boundaries. Do NOT edit files outside the allowed list.
3. Run the relevant tests from AGENTS.md to verify you haven't broken anything:
   - Engine lane: `uv run pytest -q tests/test_pptx_writer.py tests/test_learn.py tests/test_e2e_template.py tests/test_template_reflow.py`
   - Manifest lane: `uv run pytest -q tests/test_learn.py tests/test_template_layouts.py tests/test_e2e_template.py`
   - Skill lane: no unit tests, but validate with `uv run agent-slides validate`

## Phase 3: Run certification first

Run the deterministic certification layer before any demo scoring:

```
python scripts/run_cert_layer.py --run-id <run_id>
```

This writes per-template certification artifacts under `runs/<run_id>/certification/`
and merges `layers.certification` into `runs/<run_id>/summary.json`.

Certification failures do **not** block the demo layer. Record them, then continue.

## Phase 4: Build all demo benchmarks

For each benchmark in `benchmarks/`:

1. Read the brief markdown file.
2. Learn the template (if manifest doesn't exist):
   ```
   uv run agent-slides learn examples/bcg.pptx -o .artifacts/bcg.manifest.json
   ```
3. Initialize a deck with the template:
   ```
   uv run agent-slides init runs/<run_id>/<benchmark>/deck.json --template .artifacts/bcg.manifest.json
   ```
4. Build the deck content using `slide add`, `slot set`, and `batch` commands following the brief.
   Use `--auto-layout` for content slides.
5. Build the PPTX:
   ```
   uv run agent-slides build runs/<run_id>/<benchmark>/deck.json -o runs/<run_id>/<benchmark>/deck.pptx
   ```

Use a timestamp-based run ID: YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS format.

## Phase 5: Score the demo layer

Run the scoring pipeline:
```
python scripts/demo_research.py --run-id <run_id>
```

This scores only the demo benchmarks, writes `runs/<run_id>/demo-summary.json`,
and merges `layers.demo` into `runs/<run_id>/summary.json`.

## Phase 6: Record and decide

1. Read the new `summary.json`.
2. Compare against the previous best run (if any).
3. Apply the accept/reject rule from `program-demo.md`:
   - **Certification gate**: layout regressions only apply to `layers.certification`
   - **Demo gate**: mean composite and `review_quality` regression only apply to `layers.demo`
   - **Accept**: neither layer reports `reject_reasons`
   - **Reject**: mean composite regresses versus the previous best run
   - **Reject**: any benchmark `review_quality` regresses by more than 0.05 versus the same benchmark in the previous best run, even if composite improves
   - **Check**: if a benchmark has `review_available: false`, treat it as review-unavailable and confirm the scorer excluded `review_quality` from composite instead of scoring it as 0
4. Write a short summary to `runs/<run_id>/decision.md` with:
   - What was changed
   - Score delta
   - Decision (accept/reject)
   - What to try next

5. If **rejected**: revert the code changes (`git checkout -- <files>`). The run artifacts stay for analysis.
6. If **accepted**: keep the changes (do not commit — the human will review and commit).

## Constraints

- ONE hypothesis per cycle. Do not fix multiple things at once.
- Do NOT edit `program-demo.md`. The human updates the policy.
- Do NOT commit changes. Leave them as unstaged modifications.
- Do NOT edit files outside the current lane boundaries.
- Engine fixes must generalize across multiple templates. If a change only helps one template, move it into manifest or metadata work instead of core engine code.
- If tests fail after your change, revert and record the failure in decision.md.
- Maximum 3 benchmark builds per cycle (the 3 defined briefs).
