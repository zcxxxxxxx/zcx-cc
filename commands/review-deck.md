# Review Deck

Use this skill when the user asks for deck QA, visual review, design review, screenshot-based critique, or wants to know whether a PPTX deck actually looks good after render.

In this repo, prefer `uv run agent-slides ...` so the checked-out CLI and assets are used.
For command semantics and error handling, use `uv run agent-slides contract` as the canonical contract.

This skill is the rendered counterpart to `agent-slides validate`. `validate` checks structural design rules. `review` checks the real rendered output.

## Tooling contract

This workflow depends on:

- `soffice` on `PATH`
- `pdftoppm` on `PATH`

The CLI command handles the rendering pipeline:

```bash
uv run agent-slides review deck.json
```

That command:

1. builds the deck to `.pptx`
2. renders the PPTX to PDF with LibreOffice headless
3. renders slide PNGs with `pdftoppm`
4. scores the deck against the visual QA checklist
5. writes `report.md`, `report.json`, and slide screenshots into `deck.review/` by default

## Workflow Overview

Run the work in four phases:

1. First impression
2. Slide-by-slide audit
3. Scored report
4. Optional auto-fix

## CLI Surface To Use

Prefer the shipped repo commands rather than inventing alternate entry points:

- `uv run agent-slides review`
- `uv run agent-slides validate`
- `uv run agent-slides build`

## Phase 1: First impression

Start by running:

```bash
uv run agent-slides review deck.json
```

Read `report.md`, then inspect the title slide and 2-3 representative content-slide PNGs from the generated artifacts directory.

Capture three quick judgments in plain language:

- "The deck communicates ..."
- "The visual rhythm is ..."
- "If I had to grade this deck at a glance: ..."

Do not jump into detailed fixes until this gut read is clear.

## Phase 2: Slide-by-slide audit

Use the generated screenshots plus the structured report.

Use the rendered PNG as the source of truth for what the slide actually looks like.

Treat `report.json` as the machine baseline and the slide PNGs as the visual evidence.

Use this 38-item checklist directly during the audit:

### 1. Visual Hierarchy (6 items)

- [ ] Title visually dominates (largest text, distinct from body)
- [ ] Clear reading order (title -> subheader -> body -> source)
- [ ] One focal point per slide (not competing elements)
- [ ] White space is intentional (breathing room, not emptiness)
- [ ] Squint test: hierarchy still visible when mentally blurred
- [ ] Content does not touch slide edges (margins respected)

### 2. Typography (6 items)

- [ ] Heading font size 24-44pt (consistent across deck)
- [ ] Body font size 10-18pt (readable, not cramped)
- [ ] Font sizes consistent across slides (same role = same size)
- [ ] No more than 2 font families used
- [ ] Bold used sparingly (headings yes, body sparingly)
- [ ] Text not truncated or overflowing visible area

### 3. Layout Quality (6 items)

- [ ] Layout matches content relationship (isomorphism)
- [ ] Columns are balanced (similar content density)
- [ ] Charts positioned within slot bounds (not overlapping text)
- [ ] No excessive empty space in content areas
- [ ] Grid alignment consistent (elements line up)
- [ ] Image slots either filled or intentionally empty

### 4. Content Quality (8 items)

- [ ] Title is an action title (complete sentence with "so what")
- [ ] Not a topic label ("Market Overview" -> fail)
- [ ] Body content proves the title claim
- [ ] No more than 6 bullets per slide
- [ ] Bullet text is concise (not full paragraphs)
- [ ] Source line present for data claims
- [ ] Chart has title and clear labels
- [ ] Numbers are rounded and readable (`$2.5B`, not `$2,487,392,104`)

### 5. Deck-Level (6 items)

- [ ] Layout variety (2+ layouts used in 6+ slide deck)
- [ ] No 3+ consecutive slides with same layout
- [ ] Title slide present
- [ ] Closing slide present
- [ ] Visual rhythm (mix of text, charts, images)
- [ ] Consistent theme (colors and fonts do not drift)

### 6. AI Slop (6 items)

- [ ] Deck avoids every-slide-the-same layout repetition
- [ ] Deck avoids generic titles ("Introduction", "Overview", "Summary")
- [ ] Deck avoids bullet walls (every slide is not just bullets)
- [ ] Deck avoids empty image or chart slots with no content
- [ ] Deck avoids inconsistent capitalization in titles
- [ ] Deck avoids auto-generated-looking repetition or vague claims

## Phase 3: Scored report

Your output should summarize:

- category grades
- overall grade
- the top issues with screenshot evidence
- specific fixes that will materially improve the deck

Use this rubric for each category:

```text
A  = 0 failures in category
A- = 1 minor failure
B+ = 1 failure
B  = 2 failures
C+ = 3 failures
C  = 4+ failures
D  = majority of items fail
F  = category completely ignored
```

Calculate overall grade as a weighted average:

- Content Quality counts 2x
- AI Slop Detection counts 1.5x
- Visual Hierarchy, Typography, Layout Quality, and Deck-Level Patterns count 1x each

Prefer pointing to concrete slide files such as:

```text
[screenshot: deck.review/run/slides/slide-03.png]
```

If the user wants only the findings, stop here.

## Phase 4: Optional auto-fix

Only use auto-fix when the user explicitly wants fixes applied. The explicit approval path is:

```bash
uv run agent-slides review deck.json --fix
```

Use an iterative fix loop, not a single cleanup pass:

```text
Fix Loop (max 3 passes):
  Pass N:
    -> Fix top issue
    -> Re-render affected slide via LibreOffice
    -> Re-evaluate against checklist
    -> Pass? -> next issue
    -> Still failing after 2 attempts? -> flag as unresolvable, move on

  Stop early when: all categories B+ or above, or 3 passes complete
  Each fix produces a before/after PNG pair as evidence
```

Apply fixes in this priority order:

1. Content quality (action titles, body proves title)
2. Bullet count (split slides >6 bullets)
3. Missing elements (chart titles, source lines)
4. Layout variety (swap repeated layouts)
5. Visual issues (spacing, alignment)

Within that loop, prefer these common mechanical fixes when they match the top issue:

- rewrite generic topic-label titles using slide evidence when possible
- add missing chart titles
- add missing source lines for quantified claims
- split bullet-heavy `title_content` slides into a follow-up slide
- swap repeated layouts when deck-level monotony is dragging the grade
- rerender the deck and produce before/after comparison output for each fix

After `--fix`, inspect the new `after/` screenshots and compare the `before` and `after` grades in `report.json`.

Document the iterative fix loop explicitly:

```text
Fix Loop (max 3 passes):
  Pass N:
    -> Fix top issue
    -> Re-render affected slide
    -> Re-evaluate against checklist
    -> Pass? -> next issue
    -> Still failing after 2 attempts? -> flag as unresolvable, move on

  Stop when: all categories B+ or above, or 3 passes complete
```

Loop rules:

- Max 3 passes over the full deck
- Within each pass, max 2 attempts per issue before moving on
- Each fix produces a before/after PNG pair as evidence
- Stop early if all categories are B+ or above
- Never loop on subjective items only; prioritize concrete checklist failures

## Working standard

A good run of this skill leaves behind:

- rendered slide PNGs
- a readable `report.md`
- a structured `report.json`
- screenshot-backed issue evidence
- before/after comparison artifacts when fixes are applied

If the render pipeline is unavailable, stop and report the missing tool exactly as the CLI surfaces it.
